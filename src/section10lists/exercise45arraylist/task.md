It's now time for a challenge, to practice  what you've learned for ArrayLists. 

The challenge is to create an  interactive console program. 

And give the user a menu of options as shown here:

Using the Scanner class, solicit a menu item,  0, 1 or 2, and process the item accordingly. 

This means if the user enters  0, you should quit the program. 

If the user enters 1, you want to prompt them  for a comma delimited list of items to add. 

And similarly, if the user  enters 2, prompt them for a list,  

again comma delimited, to  remove from the grocery list. 

Your grocery list should be an ArrayList. You should use methods on the ArrayList, to add items, remove items, check if an item is  already in the list, and print a sorted list. 

You should print the list, sorted  alphabetically, after each operation. 

You shouldn't allow duplicate items in the list. So that's the challenge.
