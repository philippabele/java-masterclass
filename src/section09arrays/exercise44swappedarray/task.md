Let's do another quick challenge, and this one I am calling the Reversed Array Challenge.

The challenge is to write a method called reverse, that takes an int array as a parameter.

The method is going to allow the array being passed to be method to be modified. As a result,

this method shouldn't return any value. In the main method, call the reverse method,

and print the array both before and after the reverse method is called.

To reverse the array, you have to swap the elements, so that the first element

is swapped with the last element, and so on. So for example, if the array contains

the numbers 1,2,3,4,5, then the reversed array should be, 5,4,3,2,1.

Alright, so that's it, see if you can figure that out.
