Alright, it's time for another challenge.

This is the minimum element challenge. Here is what you need to do:

Write a method called readIntegers, that reads a comma delimited list of numbers, entered by
the user from the console, and then returns an array, containing those numbers that were entered.

Next, write a method called findMin, that takes the array as an argument, and returns the minimum
value found in that array. In the main method Call the method readIntegers, to get the array
of integers from the user, and print these out, using a method found in java.util.Arrays. ;

Next, call the findMin method, passing the array, returned from the call to the readIntegers method.
Print the minimum element in the array, which should be returned from the findMin method.

A tip here. Assume that the user will only enter numbers - so you don't need
to do any validation for the console input. So pause the video, try out the challenge, and
when you're ready, come back and see my solution. Pause the video now.
